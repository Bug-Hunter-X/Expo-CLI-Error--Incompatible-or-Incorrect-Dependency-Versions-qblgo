The solution involves carefully examining the `package.json` file to identify and correct any incompatible or incorrect dependency versions.  Here's how you can do that:

1. **Identify problematic dependencies:** Look for dependencies that are causing issues.  Error messages will often point to a specific package.
2. **Check for compatibility:** Verify that the versions of all your dependencies are compatible with each other and with your Expo SDK version. Consult package documentation or search for compatibility information online.
3. **Update or downgrade:** If incompatibility is detected, update or downgrade the dependency to a compatible version. You can use npm or yarn to manage your project's dependencies.
4. **Use a lockfile:** To ensure consistent builds across environments, use either `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (yarn). These lockfiles specify the exact versions of all dependencies, preventing accidental version changes.

Example: Let's say you have a conflict with `react-native-web`. You might find that version '0.18.9' is causing the issues and that version '0.17.x' is compatible.

```json
// Incorrect package.json (bug.js)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-web": "0.18.9"
  }
}

// Corrected package.json (bugSolution.js)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-web": "^0.17.7"
  }
}
```
By using a specific version or a compatible semantic version range (e.g., `^0.17.7`), you can avoid the conflict and resolve the Expo CLI error.
